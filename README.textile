h1. CukeTalker

CukeTalker is a REPL (read eval print loop) for Cucumber that allows you to
interactively write your features. It has a "show history" command that will
inform you of the commands you've entered and allows you to define new steps on
the fly. In practive, we've found that CukeTalker greatly reduces the amount of
time needed to write features.

selenium. It *may* work with other setups, but it has not be tested.
